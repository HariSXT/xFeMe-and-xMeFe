|How to use xFeMe:                                                                                         |
|xFeMe is used to turn feet into meters and Fe is short for feet and me is short for meter (Feet to Meters)|
|The x doesnt really mean anything, but it exists!                                                         |
|                                                                                                          |
|How to use xMeFe:                                                                                         |
|xMeFe is pretty much the same thing with xFeMe but it turns meter into feet (Meters to Feet)              |
|And again, the x doesnt stand for anything                                                                |

|These 2 programs are virus-free and open source.                                                          |
|Fun fact : xFeMe was created before the xMeFe and i got the idea from an english book                     |
